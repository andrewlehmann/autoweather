apt-get install python-keyring (pip install is screwy for keyring's dependencies, this includes both keyring and its dependencies)
pip install twilio
pip install requests
pip install schedule


In order for this code to work as-is, one will need to set their passwords (username/authToken for twilio) with keyring.

to do this, open the terminal, start python, import keyring, and then use 

>>>keyring.set_password("Twilio", "SampleUser", "username")
>>>keyring.set_password("Twilio", "SampleAuth", "authToken")


then, you can access that information via

>>> user = keyring.get_password("Twilio", "SampleUser")
>>> auth = keyring.get_password("Twilio", "SampleAuth")


Keyring was mostly implemented so that I could display this information online without making my API key public.
